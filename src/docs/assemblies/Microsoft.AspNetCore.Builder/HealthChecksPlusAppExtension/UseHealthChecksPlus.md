### HealthChecksPlusAppExtension.UseHealthChecksPlus method (1 of 4)
</br>


#### Adds a middleware that provides health check status.

```csharp
public static IApplicationBuilder UseHealthChecksPlus(this IApplicationBuilder app, PathString path)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| app | The IApplicationBuilder. |
| path | The path on which to provide health check status. |

### Return Value

A reference to the *app* after the operation has completed.

### Remarks

If *path* is set to `null` or the empty string then the health check middleware will ignore the URL path and process all requests. If *path* is set to a non-empty value, the health check middleware will process requests with a URL that matches the provided value of *path* case-insensitively, allowing for an extra trailing slash ('/') character.

The health check middleware will use default settings from IOptions.
